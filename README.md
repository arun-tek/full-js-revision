# full-js-revision

A compact collection of JavaScript exercises, examples, and notes meant for revision and learning. This repository contains small projects, snippets, and explanations that help you revisit core and modern JavaScript concepts.

## Contents

- exercises/ - practice problems and their solutions
- examples/ - small example projects demonstrating specific concepts
- notes/ - short write-ups and explanations
- demos/ - runnable demo code and playgrounds

## Key Topics Covered

- Core JavaScript (variables, scope, closures, hoisting)
- ES6+ features (arrow functions, modules, destructuring, async/await)
- Asynchronous patterns (promises, async/await, event loop)
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Testing basics and simple tooling
- Functional patterns and immutability

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/arun-tek/full-js-revision.git
   cd full-js-revision

2. Install dependencies (if a subproject requires it):

   npm install

3. Run examples or demos as directed in each folder's README.

## Usage

Each folder contains its own README or instructions for running the code. Common patterns:

- node path/to/script.js — run Node examples
- open demos in your browser for front-end examples
- run npm scripts where available (see package.json in each subproject)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you add exercises or examples, please:

- Keep each example focused and small
- Add a short README or comment explaining the goal
- Add tests or usage notes when applicable
